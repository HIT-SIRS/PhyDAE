## 🛰️ Overview

**PhyDAE** introduces a **physics-guided, degradation-adaptive expert framework** for unified remote sensing image restoration. Unlike prior "black-box" all-in-one models, PhyDAE bridges **physical imaging principles** with **learnable expert mechanisms**, achieving **interpretable, efficient, and physically consistent restoration**.

> The two-stage cascaded architecture transforms degradation cues from *implicit features* into *explicit decision signals*, enabling precise differentiation and handling of heterogeneous degradations such as **haze, noise, blur, and low-light**.

## ⚙️ Key Features

✅ **Physics-Guided Degradation Modeling**
- Incorporates atmospheric, sensor, and illumination physics via frequency-domain constraints

✅ **Two-Stage Progressive Restoration**
- Residual manifold projection (RMP) + frequency-aware decomposition (FADD) for degradation discovery → precise adaptation

✅ **Mixture-of-Experts Network**
- Specialized experts (dehazing, denoising, deblurring, enhancement) with probabilistic routing and sparse activation

✅ **Physically Consistent Optimization**
- Degradation-Aware Optimal Transport (DAOT) loss ensures statistical-geometric fidelity across degradations

- **Expert Modules**:
  - Dehazing Expert: Atmospheric scattering removal
  - Denoising Expert: Noise suppression
  - Deblurring Expert: Motion/defocus blur correction
  - Enhancement Expert: Low-light image enhancement
- **Frequency-Aware Decomposition (FADD)**: Jointly optimizes spatial and frequency domains

### Loss Functions
- **Degradation-Aware Optimal Transport (DAOT) Loss**: Ensures statistical-geometric consistency
- **Reconstruction Loss**: L1 + Perceptual loss
- **Regularization**: Sparse activation penalty for efficient MoE routing
